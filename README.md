## Towers of Hanoi

I learned so much with this project.

Currently the controls for the game are a little laborious for the user, having to type a tower number into each input and click submit to make every move.  I would love to implement a drag and drop library to make playing the game more enjoyable.  Maybe someday I will do that!

I also had every intention to submit this with Jasmine tests, but ran out of time after implementing the UI.

This is a fansastic first eval for the program.  I'm excited to see what's next!
